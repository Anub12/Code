// If you use min heap given array will be sorted in decreasing order.
// If use max heap given array will be sorted in increasing order or normal order.

// min priority queue is also known as min heap
// max priority queue is also known as max heap


Note:-
Difference in our priority queue and inbuilt priority queue
1. isEmpty() ----> empty()
2. getSize() ----> size()
3. insert()  ----> push()
4. getMin()  ----> T top() ==> will give max element because in inbuilt priority queue is max by default
5. removeMin() ----> pop()

th:object => 

th:field => 

To bind any type of form we need these three thymeleaf attributes.

for example, look at page 3 of Thymeleaf Form Handling pdf


for variable expressions we use th:each = "variable name from java file, can be post"
proper way to write it is
	-> th:each = "post, postStat : ${posts}"
	
with above th:each attribute we can access posts from java class. We can print posts to HTML page.

Five types of Thymeleaf standard expressions:​
 ${...} : Variable expressions​
 *{...} : Selection expressions​
 #{...} : Message (i18n) expressions​
 @{...} : Link (URL) expressions​
 ~{...} : Fragment expressions
